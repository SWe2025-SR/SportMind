# Named Entity Recognition in Sports Psychology: Enhancing Mental Health Insights Through Computational Techniques

## Overview
This repository presents an advanced Named Entity Recognition (NER) framework specifically developed for applications in sports psychology. Our method effectively identifies and interprets domain-specific psychological constructs—such as stress, motivation, and resilience—in athletic contexts by integrating deep learning and cognitive modeling.

## Motivation
Understanding athletes' cognitive and emotional states is crucial for optimizing both performance and mental health. Traditional psychological assessments primarily rely on subjective self-reporting and clinical observations, which have inherent limitations such as subjectivity and limited adaptability in real-time scenarios. Our goal is to enhance these insights by leveraging computational techniques, bridging theoretical psychology frameworks with practical, personalized interventions.

## Approach
We introduce a novel Cognitive State Representation Network (CSRN), further enhanced by Hierarchical Adaptive Cognitive Optimization (HACO). This integrated approach:

- Uses hierarchical knowledge representations to improve contextual understanding.
- Implements adaptive learning mechanisms for increased interpretability and adaptability.
- Combines cognitive theory with advanced machine learning to precisely identify psychological states relevant to sports psychology.

## Key Contributions
- **Cognitive State Representation Network (CSRN)**: A specialized deep learning model tailored to recognize psychological states accurately in sports contexts.
- **Hierarchical Adaptive Cognitive Optimization (HACO)**: An adaptive learning approach that dynamically optimizes cognitive representations for better contextual coherence.
- **Enhanced Interpretability**: Unlike conventional NER systems, our method provides clearer, context-aware insights into psychological constructs.
- **Real-time Adaptability**: Ability to adapt quickly to new data, improving real-time mental health monitoring and intervention.

## Results
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional NER methods in:

- Recognition accuracy of psychological constructs.
- Contextual coherence of identified entities.
- Potential for practical, personalized mental health interventions for athletes.
